# Quality Metrics in Software Architecture

**Paper Title**: Quality Metrics in Software Architecture

**Submitted to**: 16th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA)

**Abstract**: The importance of software architecture is largely recognized also in iterative and agile development settings. However, it is quite complex to provide evidence that the architecture is of good quality and that the architectural decisions are appropriate, correct, or optimal. Architecture evaluation aims at showing and providing confidence that design decisions contribute to fulfill the stakeholder concerns. Some architecture evaluation methods are scenario-based and aim at balancing many and  potentially conflicting quality attributes. Other works focus on a specific quality attribute and provide metrics to automatically measure it. This paper aims at surveying the state of the art to identify metrics that have been proposed for evaluating architectures. The elicited metrics are organized into categories and associated to the specific quality attributes they aim to measure. In this way, researchers and practitioners can easily retrieve the metrics that are  appropriate to their specific needs.
